# Intro
This is my first generative ai development attemp using deep learning methods. I tried to use torch.nn which uses dynamic computation graphs for training. It is easy to usage, easy to development and such. Lets see where we are going.

## Version 0.1
Proto versions of both training and generative files. 50 epoch with 320x320 training size. ReLU & tanh for generator, sigmoid neuron for discriminator.
